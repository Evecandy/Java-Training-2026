### Why this matters for a Pension Company job:

Filtering: You can easily find members eligible for retirement (e.g., age > 65) or those with missing data.

Mapping: You can extract a list of email addresses from a list of Member objects to send a newsletter.

Grouping: You can group members by their specific pension plan type (e.g., Defined Benefit vs. Defined Contribution) to generate separate reports.

Reducing: You can sum up the total assets under management (AUM) by adding up every member's balance.
